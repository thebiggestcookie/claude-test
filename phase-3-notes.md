# Master Notes: Product Categorization System

## Phase 3: Basic Frontend Structure

### Completed Tasks:
1. Created Layout component (`components/Layout.tsx`)
   - Includes responsive navigation menu
   - Adapts based on user authentication status and role
2. Implemented authentication pages
   - Sign In page (`pages/auth/signin.tsx`)
   - Sign Up page (`pages/auth/signup.tsx`)
3. Updated Home page (`pages/index.tsx`)
   - Added introduction to the Product Categorization System
   - Displays different content for authenticated and non-authenticated users

### Next Steps:
1. Implement dashboard page for authenticated users
2. Create admin panel for users with ADMIN role
3. Develop grading interface for HUMAN_GRADER role
4. Implement proper error handling and validation for authentication forms
5. Add loading states to improve user experience during authentication
6. Consider adding password reset functionality

### Important Notes:
- Ensure NextAuth.js is properly configured in `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts`
- Update `_app.tsx` to include SessionProvider from NextAuth.js
- Make sure all necessary dependencies are installed (`next-auth`, `@types/next-auth`)
- Test the authentication flow thoroughly, including edge cases
- Consider adding unit tests for components and integration tests for authentication flow

### Potential Improvements:
- Implement more robust form validation (e.g., password strength, email format)
- Add animations for smoother transitions between pages
- Implement dark mode toggle using Tailwind CSS
- Add breadcrumbs for better navigation in nested pages (future phases)

## Phase 4: User Management

### Completed Tasks:
1. Created User List Page (`pages/users/index.tsx`)
   - Displays all users in a table format
   - Implements role management functionality
   - Restricts access to admin users only
2. Created User Profile Page (`pages/users/[id].tsx`)
   - Shows detailed user information
   - Allows profile editing for the user or admins
   - Implements role-based access control

### Next Steps:
1. Update `types/user.ts` to include the User interface:
   ```typescript
   export interface User {
     id: number;
     username: string;
     email: string;
     role: 'USER' | 'ADMIN' | 'HUMAN_GRADER';
   }
   ```

2. Ensure API routes are properly implemented:
   - Review and update `/api/users` route
   - Review and update `/api/users/[id]` route

3. Update Layout component:
   - Add link to User List page in navigation for admin users

4. Thorough testing:
   - Test User List Page functionality
   - Test User Profile Page functionality
   - Verify role-based access control is working correctly

5. Error handling and validation:
   - Implement proper error messages for API failures
   - Add input validation for user editing

6. Performance optimization:
   - Consider implementing pagination for User List Page
   - Optimize API calls and state management

### Important Notes:
- Ensure consistent error handling across all user management features
- Keep in mind the potential need for more advanced filtering and sorting in the User List Page for future scalability
- Consider implementing audit logs for user role changes
- Think about adding a user search functionality for larger user bases

### Potential Improvements:
- Add ability to create new users from the admin interface
- Implement user deletion or deactivation functionality
- Add more detailed user statistics (e.g., last login, account creation date)
- Consider adding a user activity log

Remember to keep the interoperability requirements in mind as you progress to more complex features in future phases. Ensure that the user management system integrates well with other components of the Product Categorization System.
