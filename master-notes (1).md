## Phase 5: Category Management

### Completed Tasks:
1. Created Category List Page (`pages/categories/index.tsx`)
   - Implemented pagination for better performance with large numbers of categories
   - Added form for creating new categories
   - Implemented role-based access control (only accessible to admins)
2. Created Category Detail Page (`pages/categories/[id].tsx`)
   - Allows viewing, editing, and deleting individual categories
   - Implements role-based access control
3. Updated `types/category.ts` to include the Category interface
4. Implemented API routes for categories:
   - `/api/categories` for listing and creating categories
   - `/api/categories/[id]` for getting, updating, and deleting individual categories
5. Updated Layout component to include a link to the Category List page for admin users
6. Implemented error handling and form validation:
   - Created `utils/categoryValidation.ts` for form validation logic
   - Added validation to Category List and Category Detail pages
   - Updated API routes to handle errors and perform server-side validation

### Next Steps:
1. Thorough testing:
   - Test Category List Page functionality, including pagination
   - Test Category Detail Page functionality
   - Verify role-based access control is working correctly
   - Test error handling and validation for all category operations

2. Implement Department management:
   - Create Department List and Detail pages
   - Implement API routes for departments
   - Add form validation for department operations

3. Enhance error handling:
   - Implement more detailed error messages
   - Add logging for debugging purposes
   - Improve frontend error display for server-side validation errors

4. Performance optimization:
   - Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize database queries if needed

### Important Notes:
- Ensure consistent error handling across all category management features
- Keep in mind the potential need for more advanced filtering and sorting in the Category List Page for future scalability
- Consider implementing audit logs for category changes
- Think about adding a category search functionality for larger category bases

### Potential Improvements:
- Add ability to reorder categories or set custom sort orders
- Implement a tree view for visualizing the category hierarchy
- Add bulk operations for categories (e.g., bulk delete, bulk move)
- Consider adding category attributes or metadata for more detailed categorization

Remember to keep the interoperability requirements in mind as you progress to more complex features in future phases. Ensure that the category management system integrates well with other components of the Product Categorization System, particularly with the upcoming product management and AI-assisted categorization features.
