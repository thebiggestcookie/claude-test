# Project Overview

This project appears to be a web application for managing and displaying information about movies. The main components and functionalities of the app seem to be:

1. **Movie Management**: The app allows for adding, updating, and deleting movie information. This includes details such as title, release year, genre, and plot.

2. **User Authentication**: There's a login system in place, suggesting that certain functionalities might be restricted to authenticated users.

3. **API Integration**: The app integrates with an external movie database API (possibly TMDB or OMDB) to fetch additional movie information.

4. **Database Interaction**: The app uses a database (likely SQL-based) to store and retrieve movie information.

5. **Frontend**: The frontend is built using React, with components for displaying movie lists, individual movie details, and forms for adding/editing movies.

6. **Backend**: The backend is implemented in Python, possibly using a framework like Flask or Django (though the specific framework is not clear from the available files).

7. **Search Functionality**: There seems to be a search feature to find movies based on certain criteria.

8. **Responsive Design**: The use of CSS suggests that the app is designed to be responsive and work across different device sizes.

9. **Error Handling**: There are provisions for handling and displaying errors, both on the frontend and backend.

10. **Testing**: There are test files present, indicating that the project includes unit testing for various components.

The overall purpose of the app appears to be providing a platform for users to browse, search, and manage a collection of movies, with the ability to view detailed information about each movie.
